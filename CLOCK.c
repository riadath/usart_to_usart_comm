	* Steps to be followed to configure clock 
	* 1. Enable HSE (High SPeed External Clock) and wait for HSE to become ready 
	*			-- HSE (i) External Crystal/ceramic resonator (ii) HSE external user clock
	* 2. Set the power enable clock and volatge regulator
	* 3. Configure the FLASH PREFETCH and the LATENCY Related Settings 
	* 4. Configure the PRESCALERS HCLK, PCLK1, PCLK2
  * 5. Configugure the main PLL
	* 6. Enable PLL and wait for it to become ready
	* 7. Select clock source and wait for it to be set
	* Clock Set done
